# Data Analytics on Indigenous Inclusion in Queensland Innovation Ecosystem (IFN619 – Assignment 2)

This project explores the level of Indigenous participation in the Queensland (QLD) innovation ecosystem using a combination of **structured government data** and **unstructured media content** from news articles. The analysis aims to evaluate the effectiveness of existing initiatives such as “Closing the Gap” and the “Treaty with First Nations” programs, and whether these efforts are genuinely translating into positive outcomes for Indigenous communities.

## 📌 Project Goals

- Examine structured datasets reflecting innovation participation and government initiatives.
- Use **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to analyse media coverage and public discourse using The Guardian API.
- Apply a **machine learning model** to identify trends or cluster media sentiment over time.
- Investigate and communicate key **ethical considerations** such as bias, inclusion, and Indigenous representation.
- Present actionable insights appropriate for policymakers and community stakeholders.

## 🔍 Key Insight

> The analysis shows that while policy intentions may be inclusive, **implementation is falling short**. Structured data suggests a **decline in Indigenous participation**, while media articles corroborate these findings by highlighting Indigenous exclusion in decision-making. The government must re-evaluate its programs and **actively include Indigenous voices** to foster a more equitable innovation ecosystem.

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques

- Python, Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, Plotly Express
- NLP using The Guardian API
- Machine Learning: Clustering / Decision Trees
- Ethical Analysis Framework from IFN619 coursework

## 🧠 Ethical Considerations

- **Media Bias**: Investigated whether article tone aligned or diverged from factual data.
- **Representation**: Analysed whose voices are present in media narratives.
- **Data Fairness**: Discussed how exclusion from data-driven programs could reinforce systemic inequities.
